Compiling IVAN under different systems
--------------------------------------

Under Linux and OS X, type:

cmake .
make -j
make install

Note: Wizard Mode is disabled by default. To enable it run:

cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-DWIZARD .
make -j
make install

--------------------------------------

Under DOS:

If you have DJGPP 2.03+ and gcc 2.952+
installed, type:

make -f ivandj.mak

You need to install SDL development libraries,
which can be downloaded from:

http://www.libsdl.org/

--------------------------------------

Under Windows - Visual Studio:


Install SDL2

Download SDL2-devel-2.0.4-VC.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/
and install somewhere in system, e.g. D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4


Set system environment variable SDL2DIR to "D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4".
Make sure to open command prompt after that (so this variable is taken into account).

Alternatively set it just in current command prompt:

set SDL2DIR=D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4


Compile IVAN

Either use cmake-gui, or:

mkdir vs2015
cd vs2015
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ..

Now open vs2015/ivan.sln in VS2015 IDE.

--------------------------------------

Under Windows - MinGW:


Install SDL2

Download SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw.tar.gz from http://www.libsdl.org/
and install somewhere in system, e.g. D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw

Set environment variable SDL2DIR to "D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw\SDL2-2.0.4\i686-w64-mingw32\".
Make sure to open command prompt after that (so this variable is taken into account).

Alternatively set it just in current command prompt:

set SDL2DIR=D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw\SDL2-2.0.4\i686-w64-mingw32\

Use command line to generate MinGW makefiles in IVAN source directory:

mkdir mingw
cd mingw
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"

Now you can compile from command line:

mingw32-make -j4
